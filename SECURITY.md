# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover security issues (e.g., remote code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure, DoS, etc.), please do NOT publicly open an Issue.

Report privately via email

Email should include:

- Vulnerability description and impact scope
- Reproduction steps or PoC (if convenient, provide minimal reproduction)
- Affected version/commit information
- Possible fix suggestions (optional)

## Handling Process (Best Effort)

- We will confirm receipt as soon as possible and proceed with reproduction and evaluation.
- Upon completion of the fix, security fixes will be noted in the release notes (with upgrade suggestions for affected users when necessary).

## Hardening Notes (Operational Security)

Default threat model unless you harden the deployment: attackers may reach public services and any principal with bus/etcd-equivalent access. The framework does **not** replace network ACLs, mTLS, or secret management.

### Cross-process bus (`zbus` / NATS, etc.)

- Payloads are **opaque bytes**; there is **no** built-in MAC/signature on the `Message` envelope. Any writer to a topic can inject bytes that become unmarshaled messages for peers.
- **Recommend**: enable authn/authz on the broker, topic isolation, TLS; keep the bus off the public Internet unless strictly necessary.

### Service discovery (etcd, etc.)

- Tampering with registrations can misroute traffic. **Recommend**: etcd auth, TLS, least-privilege client credentials.

### JavaScript engine (`zjs`) and `require`

- **Default**: if `EngineConfig.ScriptDir` is empty, **`require()` fails** (no directory sandbox → unsafe file read surface is closed by default). Set `ScriptDir` in production to a dedicated root directory.
- **Legacy**: set `EngineConfig.AllowRequireWithoutScriptDir = true` only if you accept legacy behavior (`filepath.Abs` resolution; relative paths depend on the **process working directory**, no directory sandbox).

### RPC circuit breaker (`CallActor`)

- Breaker state is tracked per **sender Actor instance** and target `actorId`, **not** globally per downstream service. Many senders calling the same target do **not** share breaker counters; add service-wide limits elsewhere if needed.

### Examples and TLS

- Example clients may offer flags that skip certificate verification (e.g. `-gmInsecure`) for demos only. Production must verify server certificates and hostnames.

### Repository hygiene (contributors)

- Do not commit: `logs/`, `*.log`, `.env`, IDE junk, configs with real secrets. Any demo certificates in-tree must be documented as **non-production** only.
